Trying to get a handle on how to best train affinity.

Variables under consideration:
gapped loss: 0, 1, 2
pose type (input data):
    A. crystal structs "crystal"  nobalance
    B. best rmsd docked "bestonly" nobalance
    C. best rmsd w/negated all other  (2X multiple) "besty" - needs reduced
    D. <2 rmsd  (nX multiple)  "posonly" nobalance - doesn't hurt to have reduced, n~4
    E. <2 rmsd w/negated highrmsd (nX multiple)  "all" - needs reduced, n~4
pose sampling (always balance):
    balanced if there are negative examples (but otherwise uniform)
    receptor stratified (not applicable to A or B)
    affinity stratified
    receptor and affinity stratified
pose prediction
    none (affonly)
    included (not applicable to A, B, or D)


Should also re-evaluate traditional hyper-parameters.
Consider slightly deeper/wider models.

Evaluation:
kind: RMSE, Spearman, and Pearson
test set: crystal only, best rmsd only, all poses (highest prediction)

Run predict using best model and best model after normalized # of iterations

#We may beoverfitting at 100k iterations (best25 typically does best).  This is significant for the smaller training sets.  However, for all/all the best results are often at 100k
#stratification hurts RMSE, but not correlation (maybe very slightly better correlation)
#receptor strat seems to be very slighly better
#training on all does best; bestonly/crystal do poorly when tested on all
#gap generally improves rmse, but not for the best rmse; doesn't help correlation
#pose scoring doesn't seem to have a strong effect one way or another
#best results are achieved testing crystal structures
#affinity selection seems to outperform pose selection

Batch normalization is helpful
--step_when 10 needs longer to train, has best single result, but not all better
not a big difference with end_cnt 5 vs 3 - in many cases "best" iteration is the same
allconv5 had best affinity, but bimodal grouping
both conv5s were better at pose selection

weight_decay/clip_gradients does not improve median test accuracy (makes it worse, but not statistically sig)
as expected, train on train gets worse
surprisingly, in some cases converge to the _exact same values_!!?
clip_gradients by itself generally improves performance and reduces variance

bate_relu_ave  does much better at pose selectio (significantly so), with less variance
definite trend that models with more parameters do better at pose selection
less clear trend with affinity prediciton - nothing significantly (p < 0.001) better, 
but almost all the new models would probably be better if they could drop the worse point
seed 0 is always worse with the new models??  are the other splits not as conservative??

looking only at the worse performer (seed 0 presumably), the best affinity prediciton models are (R > 0.57)
5_32_64_1
batch_relue_ave
5_32_32_0
5_16_64_0
5_32_32_1
5_16_32_0


the best models by top are the 7 kernels, or 5_64, but the are 62-64% vs batch_relue_ave's 71.7%
5_32_32_1  is the best (61.8%) of the good affinity models
seems like striding by 4 hurts pose selection - need good resolution
These models have one additional round of dimensionality reduction, need evaluate that effect
Also want to try dropout.

The different affinity parameters don't seem to matter much - maybe a bit more variance. 
Slightly better affinity prediction with translate=2
stride 4 definitely hurts pose selection
Not a lot of different on the conv models - 32_32_0 might be weaker, but also less prone to overfitting?

s2 does the best for pose (but only slightly better than default), 5_32_32_1 does poorly with pose - basically need more resolution?
for affinity, all pretty similar, gap may result in more variability?
5_32_32_1 had both best and worse affinity point
defaults are generaly better for affinity

ITERATION 12

Based off single axis grid search, it looks like pose scoring would like a higher capacity model
 - less pooling
 - wider convolutional outputs
The affinity model doesn't seem to benefit from these.  In fact, it prefers smaller widths, but larger kernels.
My hypothesis is the extra model capacity resuls in overfitting for affinity prediction (because there is less data)
so we may be able to rectify this with a small hidden layer or a small final convolution

Additionally, setting the middle convolution to kernel size 1 was beneficial, suggesting we try a network in network architecture.

Try reducing affinity scale parameter: highcap_wp_256_512_128_scale.model
Also, smaller last conv:

The higher capacity models outperform at pose selection, even with pooling.  Net in net does okay as well.
Interestingly, bottlenecking the affinity side sometimes adversely affects pose selection (maybe helps, or doesn't hurt, affinity).
Net-in-net did better on pose and about the same on affinity, but had higher variance.


#followup_8_07
Reevaluating some models from hyperparameter search as well as modifications.
aff.model - best model of affinity pred (slooow)
default.model - default, for yet another baseline
faster_nin.model - the net-in-net model that had  best combined performance of models < 100ms
faster_nin_complete.model - try an atom mapping that is complete
faster_nin_weightedaff2.0.model - affinity weighting in loss layer with stdcut of 2.0
faster_nin_weightedaff3.0.model - w/3.0
top.model - best model for pose selection (slow)
